The following files in your repository are the most likely candidates that will need to be edited to implement the requested functionality:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the app title and description.
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to generate a new logo image.
3. `mini-app/app/page.tsx` – to import and render the new “suggest a food that matches the user’s mood” component.

A stylized logo featuring a smiling face made of various food items such as a slice of pizza, a bowl of soup, and a fruit salad, arranged in a circular pattern with a bright, friendly color palette. The background is a soft pastel gradient from light orange to light green, giving the logo a warm and inviting feel. The text “Mood Food” is written in a playful, rounded font below the food circle, with the word “Mood” in a bold, cheerful color and “Food” in a complementary shade. The overall design conveys a sense of joy, nourishment, and personalization.
